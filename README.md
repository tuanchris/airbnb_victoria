# Victoria through Airbnb data
A project to analyze Airbnb data for Victoria city

## Project motivation
Airbnb has put many of its data available online at Inside Airbnb including listings data for Victoria. Briefly looking at the data, it was quite obvious to me that one can tell a lot about Victoria (or any other city) by analyzing the Airbnb listings. I set out to answer the following questions using the data:

1. What Victoria neighborhood has the most listings?
2. What is the most popular neighborhood according to reviews?
3. What is the best time of year to visit Victoria?
4. What amenities are the most common? Are they differ across neighborhoods?
5. Can we predict price of a new listing?
## Library used
For this project, I mainly use pandas and python for analysis, plotnine (a port of ggplot to python) for visualization, ans sklearn for ml moodeling.

## File descriptions
listings.csv: main files that have all of the listings with its features
calendar.csv: detailed calendar for the listings
reviews.csv: detailed reviews for the listings
Victoria Airbnb analysis.ipynb: notebook with complete code cell
## Results
My post in Medium summarizes the main findings of the analysis.
